## Welcome, Traveler!

You've stumbled upon my little corner of the web. Pull up a chair, grab a cup of coffee, and let me tell you about this place.

## Why Build a Retro Site?

In an age of cookie-cutter templates and infinite scroll, I wanted something different. Something that reminds me of the early days of the web, when every site had personality. Remember when visiting a new website felt like an adventure?

The modern web is incredible - we have frameworks, build tools, and capabilities that would have seemed like magic in 1996. But somewhere along the way, we lost some of that charm. The quirky backgrounds, the visitor counters, the "under construction" GIFs.

This site is my attempt to merge the best of both worlds:

- **Modern tooling** - Built with SvelteKit for that sweet, sweet developer experience
- **Retro aesthetics** - Classic color schemes, pixel-perfect details, and unabashed nostalgia
- **Fast and accessible** - Because the 90s web was slow enough for all of us

## A Bit of Code

Since this is a developer's site, here's a taste of what powers it:

```javascript
// The spirit of the old web, wrapped in modern syntax
function greetVisitor(name) {
  const messages = [
    "Welcome to my homepage!",
    "Thanks for stopping by!",
    "You are visitor number: ??????"
  ];
  return messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
}
```

And for those who appreciate the classics:

```html
<!-- The tag that started it all -->
<marquee>Welcome to my site!</marquee>

<!-- Yes, it still works. No, you probably shouldn't use it. -->
<!-- But isn't that what makes it fun? -->
```

## What You'll Find Here

I plan to write about:

- **Web Development** - Tips, tricks, and the occasional rant
- **Retro Computing** - Celebrating the machines that got us here
- **Personal Projects** - Things I'm building and breaking

## Let's Connect

The web was built for connection. Feel free to explore, and if you find something interesting, let me know!
